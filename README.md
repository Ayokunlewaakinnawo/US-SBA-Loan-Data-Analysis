Short Description about Dataset :This Dataset was extrapplated micro loan based of on The 7(a) Loan Program. These loans were initiated by contacting a lending institution and completing their application and are made between the borrower and lender, not between the borrower and SBA.

The 7(a) Loan Program, SBAâ€™s most common loan program, includes financial help for small businesses with special requirements. This is the best option when real estate is part of a business purchase, but it can also be used for: 

Short- and long-term working capital 
Refinance current business debt 
Purchase furniture, fixtures, and supplies 
The maximum loan amount for a 7(a) loan is $5 million. Key eligibility factors are based on what the business does to receive its income, its credit history, and where the business operates. Your lender will help you figure out which type of loan is best suited for your needs.
